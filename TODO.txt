BUGS:

-The user can't advance to the next row by using the Next Row button if some of the fields
are blank. See "def row_change(self):". 
However, if a user clicks on a row and deletes one of the fields,
They can then click back to a later row and continue since the Next Row button has already been pressed a few times
to generate those rows. To resolve this, there needs to be a mechanism to validate all the rows and not just the current one.
Either that or prevent the user from clicking elsewhere if the current row is empty.

-Typing in the year in the spin box wether hebrew or secular produces an error:
File "C:\Users\roovy.q\Documents\HebrewDateReminder\app_gui.py", line 150, in heb_year_spin_value
    sec_year = int(year[1:]) + 1240
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''
